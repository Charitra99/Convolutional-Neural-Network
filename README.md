Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from Scratch

This repository contains a custom implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch. The goal is to build and understand the core components of a CNN without relying on high-level libraries .

Features

Fully custom CNN implementation without using tf.GradientTape for automatic differentiation

Manual forward propagation, backpropagation, and loss computation

GPU-compatible TensorFlow tensors for acceleration

Works with MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition (0-9)

Project Structure

.
â”œâ”€â”€ cnn_model.py      # Main Python script for the CNN implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # Project documentation

Requirements
Tensor-flow Version: 2.18.0    
pip install tensorflow
download dataset of Mnist handwritten digits or from keras import it

To-Do

Implement additional CNN layers 
Optimize performance and debugging tensor dimensions
Add model evaluation and accuracy metrics

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the implementation.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
